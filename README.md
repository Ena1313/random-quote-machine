# Random qoute machine

This is my first React application for freeCodeCamp's front-end library certification. 

The task is on the following link: 

https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine


It is called random quote machine and it's purpose is to generate random quotes when we push a button. With the quote we can also see the author and the color of the background changes randomly with every new quote generated.

## Quote source: https://api.quotable.io/random
